# Build custom trading algorithm 

This algorithm integrates the use of several traditional indicators (e.g. relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), and simple moving averages) with a unique indicator formed from natural language processing (NLP) in the construction of a unique model for trading. In turn, this trading model will be trained with a given stream of historical data from a stock index, backtested in another specific interval of data, and examined for results in an actual trading account with live-streamed data. The methodology, execution, and results of the algorithm will be seen clearly in an interactive dashboard at which the user will be able to select specific stocks for trading.
